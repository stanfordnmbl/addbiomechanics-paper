The model file containing optimal body scaling, marker offsets, and
mass parameters is:

Models/final.osim

This tool works by finding optimal scale factors and marker offsets at
the same time. If specified, it also runs a second optimization to
find mass parameters to fit the model dynamics to the ground reaction
force data.

The model containing the optimal body scaling and marker offsets found
prior to the dynamics fitting step is:

Models/optimized_scale_and_markers.osim

If you want to manually edit the marker offsets, you can modify the
<MarkerSet> in "Models/unscaled_but_with_optimized_markers.osim" (by
default this file contains the marker offsets found by the optimizer).
If you want to tweak the Scaling, you can edit
"Models/rescaling_setup.xml". If you change either of these files,
then run (FROM THE "Models" FOLDER, and not including the leading ">
"):

 > opensim-cmd run-tool rescaling_setup.xml
           # This will re-generate Models/optimized_scale_and_markers.osim


You do not need to re-run Inverse Kinematics unless you change
scaling, because the output motion files are already generated for you
as "*_ik.mot" files for each trial, but you are welcome to confirm our
results using OpenSim. To re-run Inverse Kinematics with OpenSim, to
verify the results of AddBiomechanics, you can use the automatically
generated XML configuration files. Here are the command-line commands
you can run (FROM THE "IK" FOLDER, and not including the leading "> ")
to verify IK results for each trial:

 > opensim-cmd run-tool walking2_ik_setup.xml
           # This will create a results file IK/walking2_ik_by_opensim.mot
 > opensim-cmd run-tool squatsAsym1_ik_setup.xml
           # This will create a results file IK/squatsAsym1_ik_by_opensim.mot
 > opensim-cmd run-tool walkingTS3_ik_setup.xml
           # This will create a results file IK/walkingTS3_ik_by_opensim.mot
 > opensim-cmd run-tool squats1_ik_setup.xml
           # This will create a results file IK/squats1_ik_by_opensim.mot

           # This will create a results file IK/DJ3_ik_by_opensim.mot


To re-run Inverse Dynamics using OpenSim, you can also use
automatically generated XML configuration files. WARNING: Inverse
Dynamics in OpenSim uses a different time-step definition to the one
used in AddBiomechanics (AddBiomechanics uses semi-implicit Euler,
OpenSim uses splines). This means that your OpenSim inverse dynamics
results WILL NOT MATCH your AddBiomechanics results, and YOU SHOULD
NOT EXPECT THEM TO. The following commands should work (FROM THE "ID"
FOLDER, and not including the leading "> "):
