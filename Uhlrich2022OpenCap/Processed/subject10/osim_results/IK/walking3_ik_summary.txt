Trial walking3: Inverse Kinematics Summary
----------------------------------------------

Automatic processing achieved the following marker errors, averaged
over all frames of this trial:

  - Avg. Marker RMSE      = 2.39 cm
  - Avg. Marker Max Error = 6.22 cm

Markers with large root-mean-square error:

  - WARNING: Marker R_wrist_ulna has RMSE = 6.23 cm!
  - WARNING: Marker R_wrist_radius has RMSE = 6.01 cm!
  - WARNING: Marker L_wrist_ulna has RMSE = 5.19 cm!
  - WARNING: Marker L_wrist_radius has RMSE = 4.52 cm!
  - WARNING: Marker C7 has RMSE = 4.37 cm!

Additional information:

  - INFO: The marker "L_HJC_reg" appears in the mocap data, but not on the model.
  - INFO: The marker "L_forearm" appears in the mocap data, but not on the model.
  - INFO: The marker "L_humerus" appears in the mocap data, but not on the model.
  - INFO: The marker "R_HJC_reg" appears in the mocap data, but not on the model.
  - INFO: The marker "R_forearm" appears in the mocap data, but not on the model.
  - INFO: The marker "R_humerus" appears in the mocap data, but not on the model.
  - INFO: The marker "L_mankle" appears in the model, but not in the mocap data. This generally happens because the marker is a virtual marker. We ignore virtual markers, so this is not a problem, just a heads up..
  - INFO: The marker "L_mknee" appears in the model, but not in the mocap data. This generally happens because the marker is a virtual marker. We ignore virtual markers, so this is not a problem, just a heads up..
